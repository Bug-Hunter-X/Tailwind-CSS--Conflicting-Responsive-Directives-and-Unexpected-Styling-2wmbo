This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with complex responsive design scenarios. The issue arises when multiple responsive directives conflict, resulting in unexpected styles being applied or styles being overridden. For instance, using `md:hidden` and `lg:block` simultaneously on the same element might lead to inconsistencies based on screen size transitions.  Another common issue is when using `@apply` with conflicting directives, causing unpredictable styles.
