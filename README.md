# Tailwind CSS: Conflicting Responsive Directives and Unexpected Styling

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to conflicting responsive directives.  The bug arises when multiple directives, especially those controlling visibility (`hidden`, `block`, etc.) across different breakpoints, conflict, leading to inconsistent or unexpected styling behavior.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is unexpected behavior when combining Tailwind's responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:hidden`, `lg:block`) on the same element.  The order of these directives can significantly impact the final rendered styles, and the behavior is not always intuitive.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` to examine the problematic CSS. Notice the use of conflicting responsive modifiers.
3. Inspect the rendered output (e.g., using a browser's developer tools) to see the unexpected styling.

## Solution

The provided solution in `bugSolution.css` offers a more robust way to manage complex responsive designs. We use a more deliberate approach to ensure the correct styles are applied at each breakpoint.  This often involves rewriting selectors to account for specific viewport conditions in a more clear and maintainable fashion.
